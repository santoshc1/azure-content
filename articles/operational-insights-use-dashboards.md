<h1>Operational Insights Dashboards</h1>

This guide helps you understand how Operational Insights Dashboards can visualize all of your saved searches, giving you a single lens to view your environment.

<h2 id="">Adding a Tile</h2>

In dashboards, tiles are powered by your saved searches. Operational Insights comes with many pre-made saved searches, so you can begin right away. You'll see the following pictorial outlining how to begin.

<h3 id="">Tile Visualizations</h3>
There are two kinds of tile visualizations to choose from:

<h5 id="">Bar Chart</h5>
![Bar Chart](./media/operational-insights-use-dashboards/bar-chart.png)

This displays a timeline of your saved search's results, or a list of results by a field depending on if your search aggregates results by a field or not.

<h5 id="">Metric</h5>
![Metric](./media/operational-insights-use-dashboards/metric.png)

This displays your total search result hits as a number in a tile. Metric tiles allow you to set a threshold that will highlight the tile when the threshold is reached.

<h3 id="">Threshold</h3>
You can create a threshold on a tile using the Metric visualization. Select on to create a threshold value on the tile. Choose whether to highlight the tile when the value is over or under the chosen threshold, then set the threshold value below.

<h2 id="">Organizing the Dashboard</h2>
To organize your dashboard, navigate to the My Dashboard view and click on the 'customize' gear at the bottom of the page to enter customize mode. Click and drag the tile you want to move, and move it to where you want your tile to be.
