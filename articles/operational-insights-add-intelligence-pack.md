#Add or remove intelligence packs

Microsoft Azure Operational Insights includes the base Configuration Assessment module. However, you can get additional functionality by adding intelligence packs to it.

After you have added an intelligence pack, data is collected from the servers in your infrastructure and sent to the Operational Insights service. Processing by the Operational Insights service can take from a few minutes to several hours. After the service processes the data, you can view it in Operational Insights.

You can easily remove an intelligence pack when it is no longer needed. When you remove an intelligence pack, its data is not sent to Operational Insights, which reduces the amount of data used by your daily quota.
