## Reconfigure the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (Optional)
Use the following information to enable an agent to communicate directly with the Microsoft Azure Operational Insights service. After you've configured the agent, it will register with the agent service and will get necessary configuration information and management packs that contain intelligence pack information.

After data is collected from computers monitored by the agent, the number of computers monitored will appear in the Operational Insights portal on the Usage page under **Directly Connected Agents**. For any computer that sends data, you can view its data and assessment information in the Operational Insights portal.

- Open Microsoft Monitoring Agent and then click the **Azure Operational Insights** tab.
- Clear Connect to **Azure Operational Insights**.

### To Enable the agent using the command line or script
You can use either Windows PowerShell or a VB script with the following example.
    $healthServiceSettings = New-Object -ComObject 'AgentConfigManager.MgmtSvcCfg'
    $healthServiceSettings.EnableOnlineMonitoring('workspacename', 'workspacekey')
    $healthServiceSettings.ReloadConfiguration()
