# Search for data

You can use the Search feature in Microsoft Azure Operational Insights to find data that you’re looking for. On the Search page, you can create a query, and then when you search, you can filter the results by using facet controls. You can also create advanced queries to transform, filter, and report on your results.

Common search queries appear on most search pages. Throughout the Operational Insights console, you can click tiles or drill in to other items to view details about the item by using Search.
