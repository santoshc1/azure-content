# Set up your workspace 

To create a new Microsoft Azure Operational Insights workspace, you choose a workspace name, associate it with your account, and you choose a geographical location. An Operational Insights workspace is essentially a container that includes account information and simple configuration information for the account. You or other members of your organization might use multiple Operational Insights workspaces to manage different sets of data that is collected from all or portions of your IT infrastructure.

After the workspace is created, you can perform other tasks using the workspace, such as manage Operational Insights, view your usage data in the dashboard, select storage accounts, and directly connect agents or to connect to System Center Operations Manager.
