#Media Services Video-on-Demand Workflow

##Overview

This topic describes steps of a typical Azure Media Services (AMS) Video-on-Demand workflow. Each step links to relevant topics. For tasks that can be achieved using different technologies, there are buttons that link to technology of your choice (for example, .NET or REST).   

Note that you can integrate Media Services with your existing tools and processes. For example, encode content on-site then upload to Media Services for transcoding into multiple formats and deliver through Azure CDN, or a third-party CDN. 

The following diagram shows the major parts of the Media Services platform that are involved in the Video on Demand Workflow.
![VoD workflow][vod-overview]

##Creating a Media Services account

Use **Azure Management Portal** to [Create Azure Media Services Account](../media-services-create-account/). 

##Setting up development environment  

Choose **.NET** or **REST API** for your development environment.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-setup](../includes/media-services-selector-setup.md)]

##Connecting programmatically  

Choose **.NET** or **REST API** to programmatically connect to Azure Media Services.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-connect](../includes/media-services-selector-connect.md)]

##Uploading media 

Upload your files using **Azure Management Portal**, **.NET** or **REST API**.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-upload-files](../includes/media-services-selector-upload-files.md)]

##Processing media

###Getting Media Processor

Get Media Processor with **.NET** or **REST API**.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-get-media-processor](../includes/media-services-selector-get-media-processor.md)]

###Creating jobs 

A job is an entity that contains metadata about a set of tasks (for example, encoding or indexing). Each task performs an atomic operation on the input asset(s). For example on how to create encoding jobs, see:

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-encode](../includes/media-services-selector-encode.md)]

###Monitoring job progress

Monitor job progress using **Azure Management Portal**, **.NET** or **REST API**.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-job-progress](../includes/media-services-selector-job-progress.md)]

###Indexing

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-index-content](../includes/media-services-selector-index-content.md)]

###Encoding 

Encode with **Azure Media Encoder** using **Azure Management Portal**, **.NET**, or **REST API**.
 
[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-encode](../includes/media-services-selector-encode.md)]

For more information, see [Encoding and Packaging](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn621224.aspx).

##Configure content key authorization policy 

Configure key authorization policy using **.NET** or **REST API**.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-content-key-auth-policy](../includes/media-services-selector-content-key-auth-policy.md)]

##Configuring asset delivery policy

Configure asset delivery policy using **.NET** or **REST API**.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-asset-delivery-policy](../includes/media-services-selector-asset-delivery-policy.md)]

##Publishing assets

Publish assets (by creating Locators) using **Azure Management Portal** or **.NET**.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-publish](../includes/media-services-selector-publish.md)]

##Scaling a Media Services account

You can scale **Media Services** by specifying the number of **Streaming Reserved Units** and **Encoding Reserved Units** that you would like your account to be provisioned with. 

For information about scaling streaming units, see: [How to scale streaming units](../media-services-manage-origins#scale_streaming_endpoints).

For information about scaling encoding units, see the following **Portal** and **.NET** topics.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [media-services-selector-scale-encoding-units](../includes/media-services-selector-scale-encoding-units.md)]

You can also scale your Media Services account by adding storage accounts to it. Each storage account is limited to 500 TB. To expand your storage beyond the default limitations, you can choose to attach multiple storage accounts to a single Media Services account.

For more information, see [Managing Media Services Assets across Multiple Storage Accounts](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn271889.aspx) and [Working with Azure Storage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn767951.aspx).


##Playback your content
